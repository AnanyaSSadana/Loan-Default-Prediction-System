# Loan Default Prediction System

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning application for predicting loan defaults. The system is designed for optimized performance and scalability, leveraging containerization and cloud services.

## Technologies Used
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **AWS**: For cloud services, including EKS, ECR, EC2, and ELB.
- **Python**: As the primary programming language.

## Features
- **End-to-End Deployment**: Deployed a machine learning model for loan default prediction using Kubernetes and Docker.
- **Data Preprocessing and Model Training**: Conducted data preprocessing and trained an XGBoost classifier.
- **Accelerated Inference**: Utilized the daal4Py library for faster inference.
- **Cloud Integration**: Leveraged AWS services for optimized performance and scalability.
